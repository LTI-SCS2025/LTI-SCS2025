# Overview

Student Research Symposium (SRS) is an LTI-wide event for students to show their recent and/or ongoing research and projects to the community. Submissions from students are selected to be presented as talks or posters/demos throughout the day-long event. During the event, talks and posters/demos are judged by a panel of students and faculty<!--, and cash prizes are given to the winners ($500 prize for the main and demo tracks, $250 prize for the preliminary work and theme tracks). -->This is a great chance to enjoy the camaraderie of students and faculty, and munch on good food together! In addition, if you have a speaking requirement for your degree program (e.g., MLT), participating in this event can fulfill that requirement!
